Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects
are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.

If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an
introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.

However, here is small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to bring you at speed −

Overview of OOP Terminology
Class: A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the
class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

Class variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but
outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.

Data member: A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.

Function overloading: The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies
by the types of objects or arguments involved.

Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.

Inheritance: The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.

Instance: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an
instance of the class Circle.

Instantiation: The creation of an instance of a class.

Method : A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.

Object: A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class
variables and instance variables) and methods.

Operator overloading: The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.

Creating Classes
The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword class
followed by a colon as follows −

class ClassName:
   'Optional class documentation string'
   class_suite

The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via ClassName.__doc__.
The class_suite consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes and functions.

Example
Following is the example of a simple Python class −
class Employee:
   'Common base class for all employees'
   empCount = 0

   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1

   def displayCount(self):
     print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print "Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary

- The variable empCount is a class variable whose value is shared among all instances of a this class. This can be accessed
as Employee.empCount from inside the class or outside the class

- The firs method __init__() is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that python
calls when you create a new instance of this class

- you declare other class mehods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is self.
Pythod adds the self arguments to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods
