<body>
Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interative, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created
by Guido Van Rossum during 1985 - 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License
(GPL).

</head>
<body>
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interative and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly
readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use puntuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions
than other languages.

    <title>Python 3 - Environment Setup</title>
</head>
<body>
Python 3 is available on for Windows, Mac OS and most of the flavours of Linux operating systems. Even through Python 2
is available for many other OSs, Python 3 support either has not been made available for them or has been dropped.

Python Environment Variables
PYTHONPATH: It ha a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported
into a program. It shoould include the Python source library

Running Python
There are three different ways to start Python:

(1) Interative Interpreter:
You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.

(2) Script from the Command-line:
A python script can be executed at command line by invoking the interpreter on your application, as in the following

(3) Integrated Development Environment
You can run Python from a Grafical User Interface (GUI) enviroment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system
that supports Python

<body>
The python language has many similarities to Perl, C and Java. However, there are some definite differentes between the languages

First Python Program
Let us execute programs in different modes of programming
Interative Mode programming

Script Mode programming

Python Identifiers
A python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, funtion, class, module, or other object. An identifier starts
with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9)

Python does not allow puntuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming
language. Thus Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.

Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers -
- Class names start with and uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter
- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private
- Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier
- If the identifier also ends with tow trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name
